# 3E
Snippets using Python with 3E

## Requirements
To play with these they should be run in an [python virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/). I try to use environment variables where it makes sense to do so. On Windows, this would be in your environment's Scripts/activate.bat folder. Set them with commands like:

```
SET WSDL=http://elitewapi/TE_3E_INSTANCE/WebUI/Transactionservice.asmx?wsdl
SET URL=http://elitewapi/TE_3E_INSTANCE/WebUI/Transactionservice.asmx
```

You'll probably also want to run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

to obtain the needed libraries.
